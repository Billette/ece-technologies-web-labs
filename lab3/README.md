# Lab 2


In this lab, we were asked to do a simple project that runs a 'hello world' app.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you first need to install ```nodejs```.


## Installing Lab 2 TypeScripte

Move to your project directory after cloning the repository. Then, run the command :
```
    npm install
``` 

To start the server, just type the command :
```
    npm start
``` 

## Using Lab 2 typeScript

The first step when you started the local server is going to the following URL :

[Localhost](http://localhost:8080)

You should have an HTML page describing the actions required to continue.

Typing the following URL will route you to this page :

[My name is foo](http://localhost:8080/hello/foo)

You can then press the metrics button to display the metrics (dummy data). They are visible by typing this url :

[Metrics.json](http://localhost:8080/metrics.json)
