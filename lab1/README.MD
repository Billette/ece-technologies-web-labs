# Lab 1


In this lab, we were asked to do a simple project that runs a 'hello world' app.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you first need to install ```yarn``` or  ```npm```. You also need ```nodejs```.



## Installing Lab 1

Move to your project directory after cloning the repository. Then, run the command :
```
    npm install
``` 

To start the server, just type the command :
```
    npm run start
``` 

## Using Lab 1

The first step when you started the local server is going to the following URL :

[Localhost](http://localhost:8080)

You should have the message prompted in plain text :

```
You should put in your URL the "/hello?name=" and your name.
```

Typing the following URLs will route you to these pages :

* [My name is foo](http://localhost:8080/hello?name=foo)
* [My name is Maxime (author of the website)](http://localhost:8080/hello?name=Maxime)
* [Going to a 404 Error](http://localhost:8080/hello?jkjk)
